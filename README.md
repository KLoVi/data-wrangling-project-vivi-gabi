Project 1 - week 3: **Stress, Lifestyle & Wellbeing**

Gabriela Clemente de Oliveira & Karoll Viviana LÃ³pez Villegas

This project main goal was to apply the learned technics for retrieving, cleaning and analysing Data Frames.

We chose this topic because, besides feeling inspired by it, stress has a huge impact not only on the individual but also on the economy.

Three different data frames were used for this analysis (included in the "data_sources" folder):

1. This dataset contains a global survey responses from www.Authentic-Happiness.com. with 23 attributes describing our lifestyle & behavior, from 07.2015 to 03. 2021:

2. Absenteeism from work due to illness, days per employee per year: https://gateway.euro.who.int/en/indicators/hfa_411-2700-absenteeism-from-work-due-to-illness-days-per-employee-per-year/#id=19398&fullGraph=true (03-07-2024)

3. Negative and Positive Experience Indexes per year: https://news.gallup.com/poll/394025/world-unhappier-stressed-ever.aspx

We also applied Web Scraping to extract Statistics Statements for our presentation (for academic and requirement purposes).

**Hypothesis & Findings:**

Questions you want to answer (maybe divided by different topics). Each question should include a conclusion written in a markdown cell.
Describe the methodology you are using, explaining the steps upi took for data cleaning, analysis, etc.
Conclusions after your analysis.
Further questions.

Weaknesses: Our main data frame had many useful data, but it unfortunatelly didn't specify the country of the people answering the survey (it only mentions it's global), so we used global data to make comparisons. I believe it would be more insightful if we could see also the demographic information.
